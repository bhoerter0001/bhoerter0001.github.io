        <p>Hi, my name is Brandi Hoerter. I chose to switch careers
            and persue a career in tech because I'm artistic and I love
            learning. I'm excited to start a career that challenges my
            knowledge, while pushes me to learn new things as well.
            I'm excited to see what the tech world has in store for me. 
        </p>
