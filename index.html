                       I greet the guest. Intoduce myself, explain the unlisted
                       specials. Take the guest orders, verify the kitchen has
                       the ticket and is working on food. Deliver food to table
                       and pass out to guest.

                        I was required to learn each station on the line

                        to being bagged and lifted off the line to be shipped
                        to the customer.

                        I created a website about myself using HTML in VS Code.
                        I pushed it through Git Bash to Git Hub.

                    <h3>Correct-the-HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        I forked and cloned a repository on Git Hub.
                        I used HTML semantics to change the code to make
                        it easier for the computer to compute.
